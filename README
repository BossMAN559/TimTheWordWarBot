Timmy - The NaNoWriMo Wordwar Bot

Timmy is an IRC bot created for use in NaNoWriMo chatrooms. He has commands to
run short wordwars (contests to write as many words as possible in a set period
of time), timers, writing challenges, and possibly other useful commands.

He also has a plethora of silly commands and abilities that serve to help
entertain the writers in the chatroom. These abilities can be disabled in any
given channel, if the people in that channel would prefer to only use the useful
commands.

Timmy was originally created in PHP in 2008 by MysteriousAges, and ported to
Java in 2009. Utoxin started helping in 2010, and has done significant work in
cleaning up the codebase and adding new advanced functionality such as the
Markhov Chain chatter code.
